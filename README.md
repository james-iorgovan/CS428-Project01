Running the Projects
Project 1
Download the project files
Open with Unity 2019.4.1 (be sure to also have Vuforia Engine installed in your Unity)
Run the webcam
Hold up at the camera:
The Drone - to see an alarm clock that displays the time
The Astronaut - to see a calandar displaying the date
The Fissure - to see a thermometer that displays the temperature as well as the humidity outside (Fissure note: you will need to sign-up for free at openweathermap in order to generate your own API key. This will allow you to get relevant data to your surrounding via a JSON file that one of the scripts I created in the Unity project reads).
The Oxygen - to see a windsock that [is supposed to] display the wind in mphs as well as the direction of the wind
